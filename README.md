# flutter_app_architecture

Flutter app architecture examples.

## Getting Started

This project is intended to help anyone have a grasp of the basics of Flutter app architecture.

I focused on showcasing 3 main architectural styles:

- Vanilla/Plain
- BLoC
- Scoped Model

**This project was developed for a talk I delivered at the Flutter Deep Dive event in Lagos, Nigeria on December 13th, 2019. See [event here](https://twitter.com/LekanBaruwa/status/1205400146168754177?s=20)
